The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) dominates the variability of the equatorial stratosphere (~16-50km) and is easily seen as downward propagating easterly and westerly wind regimes, a full cycle of the oscillation takes place approximately every 28 months. The QBO is defined as the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of quasi-biennial stratospheric zonal wind fluctuations that occur simultaneously around the equatorial belt. Almost 50 years ago, the QBO of the winds in the equatorial stratosphere was detected due to the establishment of a global, regularly measuring radiosonde network (Graystone, 1959; Ebdon, 1960). Daily values of the monthly mean zonal wind components were calculated for the levels 70, 50, 40, 30, 20, 15, and 10 hPa and a data set from 1953 to the present was produced by combining the observations of the three radiosonde stations Canton Island (closed 1967), Gan/Maledive Islands (closed 1975), and Singapore (1987 – 2021). The data set used is representative of the equatorial belt since all studies have shown that longitudinal differences in the phase of the QBO are small. 

Five additional atmospheric variables were analyzed to investigate how the QBO impacts surface and stratospheric variables. Stratospheric variables used: Ozone, Water Vapor, Temperature: Tes-Chem Monthly-mean chemical reanalysis data (2005 – 2017) ; Horizontal Resolution: 1.1° x 1.1°, 27 pressure levels from 1000 to 60 hPa. Surface variables used: Surface Variables: MSLP, SST: Era-Interim, 3rd Generation Reanalysis Product (1979 – 2018), Horizontal Resolution: 0.75° x 0.75°.
